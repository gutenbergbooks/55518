<h2>THE IRISH PROPHECY MAN.<br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<p>The individual to whom the heading of this article is uniformly
applied, stands, among the lower classes of his countrymen
in a different light and position from any of those previous
characters that we have already described to our readers.
The intercourse which <em>they</em> maintain with the people is one
that simply involves the means of procuring subsistence for
themselves by the exercise of their professional skill, and their
powers of contributing to the lighter enjoyments and more
harmless amusements of their fellow-countrymen. All the
collateral influences they possess, as arising from the hold
which the peculiar nature of this intercourse gives them, generally
affect individuals only on those minor points of feeling
that act upon the lighter phases of domestic life. They bring
little to society beyond the mere accessories that are appended
to the general modes of life and manners, and consequently
receive themselves as strong an impress from those
with whom they mingle, as they communicate to them in return.</p>

<p>Now, the Prophecy Man presents a character far different
from all this. With the ordinary habits of life he has little
sympathy. The amusements of the people are to him little
else than vanity, if not something worse. He despises that
class of men who live and think only for the present, without
ever once performing their duties to posterity, by looking into
those great events that lie in the womb of futurity. Domestic
joys or distresses do not in the least affect him, because
the man has not to do with feelings or emotions, but with
principles. The speculations in which he indulges, and by
which his whole life and conduct are regulated, place him far
above the usual impulses of humanity. He cares not much
who has been married or who has died, for his mind is, in
point of time, communing with unborn generations upon affairs
of high and solemn import. The past, indeed, is to him
something, the future every thing; but the present, unless
when marked by the prophetic symbols, little or nothing. The
topics of his conversation are vast and mighty, being nothing
less than the fate of kingdoms, the revolution of empires, the
ruin or establishment of creeds, the fall of monarchs, or the
rise and prostration of principalities and powers. How can
a mind thus engaged descend to those petty subjects of ordinary
life which engage the common attention? How could
a man hard at work in evolving out of prophecy the subjugation
of some hostile state, care a farthing whether Loghlin
Roe’s daughter was married to Gusty Given’s son, or not?
The thing is impossible. Like fame, the head of the Prophecy
Man is always in the clouds, but so much higher up as
to be utterly above the reach of any intelligence that does
not affect the fate of nations. There is an old anecdote told
of a very high and a very low man meeting. “What news
down there?” said the tall fellow. “Very little,” replied the
other: “what kind of weather have you above?” Well indeed
might the Prophecy Man ask what news there is below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
for his mind seldom leaves those aërial heights from which it
watches the fate of Europe and the shadowing forth of future
changes.</p>

<p>The Prophecy Man&mdash;that is, he who solely devotes himself
to an anxious observation of those political occurrences which
mark the signs of the times, as they bear upon the future, the
principal business of whose life it is to associate them with
his own prophetic theories&mdash;is now a rare character in Ireland.
He was, however, a very marked one. The Shanahus
and other itinerant characters had, when compared with him,
a very limited beat indeed. Instead of being confined to a
parish or a barony, the bounds of the Prophecy Man’s travels
were those of the kingdom itself; and indeed some of them
have been known to make excursions to the Highlands of
Scotland, in order if possible to pick up old prophecies, and to
make themselves, by cultivating an intimacy with the Scottish
seers, capable of getting a clearer insight into futurity,
and surer rules for developing the latent secrets of time.</p>

<p>One of the heaviest blows to the speculations of this class
was the downfall and death of Bonaparte, especially the latter.
There are still living, however, those who can get over
this difficulty, and who will not hesitate to assure you, with a
look of much mystery, that the real “Bonyparty” is alive and
well, and will make his due appearance <em>when the time comes</em>;
he who surrendered himself to the English being but an accomplice
of the true one.</p>

<p>The next fact, and which I have alluded to in treating of
the Shanahus, is the failure of the old prophecy that a George
the Fourth would never sit on the throne of England. His coronation
and reign, however, puzzled our prophets sadly, and
indeed sent adrift for ever the pretensions of this prophecy
to truth.</p>

<p>But that which has nearly overturned the system, and routed
the whole prophetic host, is the failure of the speculations so
confidently put forward by Dr Walmsey in his General History
of the Christian Church, vulgarly called Pastorini’s Prophecy,
he having assumed the name Pastorini as an <i lang="la">incognito</i> or <i lang="fr">nom
de guerre</i>. The theory of Pastorini was, that Protestantism
and all descriptions of heresy would disappear about the year
eighteen hundred and twenty-five, an inference which he drew
with considerable ingenuity and learning from Scriptural prophecy,
taken in connexion with past events, and which he
argued with all the zeal and enthusiasm of a theorist naturally
anxious to see the truth of his own prognostications verified.
The failure of this, which was their great modern standard,
has nearly demolished the political seers as a class, or compelled
them to fall back upon the more antiquated revelations
ascribed to St Columkill, St Bridget, and others.</p>

<p>Having thus, as is our usual custom, given what we conceive
to be such preliminary observations as are necessary to
make both the subject and the person more easily understood,
we shall proceed to give a short sketch of the only Prophecy
Man we ever saw who deserved properly to be called so, in the
full and unrestricted sense of the term. This individual’s
name was Barney M’Haighery, but in what part of Ireland
he was born I am not able to inform the reader. All I know
is, that he was spoken of on every occasion as The Prophecy
Man; and that, although he could not himself read, he carried
about with him, in a variety of pockets, several old books and
manuscripts that treated upon his favourite subject.</p>

<p>Barney was a tall man, by no means meanly dressed; and
it is necessary to say that he came not within the character
or condition of a mendicant. On the contrary, he was considered
as a person who must be received with respect, for the
people knew perfectly well that it was not with every farmer
in the neighbourhood he would condescend to sojourn. He
had nothing of the ascetic and abstracted meagreness of the
Prophet in his appearance. So far from that, he was inclined
to corpulency; but, like a certain class of fat men, his natural
disposition was calm, but at the same time not unmixed with
something of the pensive. His habits of thinking, as might be
expected, were quiet and meditative; his personal motions
slow and regular; and his transitions from one resting-place
to another never of such length during a single day as to
exceed ten miles. At this easy rate, however, he traversed
the whole kingdom several times; nor was there probably a
local prophecy of any importance in the country with which
he was not acquainted. He took much delight in the greater
and lesser prophets of the Old Testament: but his heart and
soul lay, as he expressed it, “in the Revelations of St John
the Divine.”</p>

<p>His usual practice was, when the family came home at
night from their labour, to stretch himself upon two chairs, his
head resting upon the hob, with a boss for a pillow, his eyes
closed, as a proof that his mind was deeply engaged with the
matter in hand. In this attitude he got some one to read the
particular prophecy upon which he wished to descant; and a
most curious and amusing entertainment it generally was to
hear the text, and his own singular and original commentaries
upon it. That he must have been often hoaxed by wags and
wits, was quite evident from the startling travesties of the
text which had been put into his mouth, and which, having
been once put there, his tenacious memory never forgot.</p>

<p>The fact of Barney’s arrival in the neighbourhood soon
went abroad, and the natural consequence was, that the
house in which he thought proper to reside for the time became
crowded every night as soon as the hours of labour
had passed, and the people got leisure to hear him. Having
thus procured him an audience, it is full time that we should
allow the fat old Prophet to speak for himself, and give us all
an insight into futurity.</p>

<p>“Barney, ahagur,” the good man his host would say,
“here’s a lot o’ the neighbours come to hear a whirrangue
from you on the Prophecies; and, sure, if you can’t give it to
them, who is there to be found that can?”</p>

<p>“Throth, Paddy Traynor, although I say it that should
not say it, there’s truth in that, at all evints. The same knowledge
has cost me many a weary blisthur an’ sore heel in
huntin’ it up an’ down, through mountain an’ glen, in Ulsther,
Munsther, Leinsther, an’ Connaught&mdash;not forgettin’
the Highlands of Scotland, where there’s what they call the
‘short prophecy,’ or second sight, but wherein there’s afther
all but little of the Irish or long prophecy, that regards
what’s to befall the winged woman that flown into the wilderness.
No, no&mdash;their second sight isn’t thrue prophecy at
all. If a man goes out to fish, or steal a cow, an’ that he
happens to be drowned or shot, another man that has the
second sight will see this in his mind about or afther the time
it happens. Why, that’s little. Many a time our own Irish
drames are aiqual to it; an’ indeed I have it from a knowledgeable
man, that the gift they boast of has four parents&mdash;an
empty stomach, thin air, a weak head, an’ strong whisky,
an’ that a man must have all these, espishilly the last, before
he can have the second sight properly; an’ it’s my own opinion.
Now, I have a little book (indeed I left my books with a friend
down at Errigle) that contains a prophecy of the milk-white
hind an’ the bloody panther, an’ a forebodin’ of the slaughter
there’s to be in the Valley of the Black Pig, as foretould by
Beal Derg, or the prophet wid the red mouth, who never was
known to speak but when he prophesied, or to prophesy but
when he spoke.”</p>

<p>“The Lord bless an’ keep us!&mdash;an’ why was he called the
Man wid the Red Mouth, Barney?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that: first, bekase he always prophesied
about the slaughter an’ fightin’ that was to take place in the
time to come; an’, secondly, bekase, while he spoke, the red
blood always trickled out of his mouth, as a proof that what
he foretould was true.”</p>

<p>“Glory be to God! but that’s wondherful all out. Well,
well!”</p>

<p>“Ay, an’ Beal Derg, or the Red Mouth, is still livin’.”</p>

<p>“Livin’! why, is he a man of our own time?”</p>

<p>“Our own time! The Lord help you! It’s more than a
thousand years since he made the prophecy. The case you
see is this: he an’ the ten thousand witnesses are lyin’ in an
enchanted sleep in one of the Montherlony mountains.”</p>

<p>“An’ how is that known, Barney?”</p>

<p>“It’s known. Every night at a certain hour one of the
witnesses&mdash;an’ they’re all sogers, by the way&mdash;must come out
to look for the sign that’s to come.”</p>

<p>“An’ what is that, Barney?”</p>

<p>“It’s the fiery cross; an’ when he sees one on aich of the
four mountains of the north, he’s to know that the same sign’s
abroad in all the other parts of the kingdom. Beal Derg an’
his men are then to waken up, an’ by their aid the Valley of
the Black Pig is to be set free for ever.”</p>

<p>“An’ what is the Black Pig, Barney?”</p>

<p>“The Prospitarian church, that stretch from Enniskillen to
Darry, an’ back again from Darry to Enniskillen.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, Barney, but prophecy is a strange thing to be
sure! Only think of men livin’ a thousand years!”</p>

<p>“Every night one of Beal Derg’s men must go to the mouth
of the cave, which opens of itself, an’ then look out for the
sign that’s expected. He walks up to the top of the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
an’ turns to the four corners of the heavens, to
thry if he can see it; an’ when he finds that he can not, he
goes back to Beal Derg, who, afther the other touches him,
starts up, an’ axis him, ‘Is the time come?’ He replies, ‘No;
the <em>man is</em>, but the <em>hour</em> is <em>not</em>!’ an’ that instant they’re both
asleep again. Now, you see, while the soger is on the mountain
top, the mouth of the cave is open, an’ any one may go
in that might happen to see it. One man it appears did, an’
wishin’ to know from curiosity whether the sogers were dead
or livin’, he touched one of them wid his hand, who started
up an’ axed him the same question, ‘Is the time come?’
Very fortunately he said ‘<em>No</em>;’ that minute the soger
was as sound in his trance as before.”</p>

<p>“An’, Barney, what did the soger mane when he said, ‘The
man is, but the hour is not?’”</p>

<p>“What did he mane? I’ll tell you that. The man is Bonyparty;
which manes, when put into proper explanation,
the <em>right side</em>; that is, the true cause. Larned men have
found <em>that</em> out.”</p>

<p>“Barney, wasn’t Columkill a great prophet?”</p>

<p>“He was a great man entirely at prophecy, and so was St
Bridget. He prophesied ‘that the cock wid the purple comb
is to have both his wings clipped by one of his own breed before
the struggle comes.’ Before that time, too, we’re to have
the Black Militia, an’ afther that it is time for every man to
be prepared.”</p>

<p>“An’, Barney, who is the cock wid the purple comb?”</p>

<p>“Why, the Orangemen to be sure. Isn’t purple their colour,
the dirty thieves?”</p>

<p>“An’ the Black Militia, Barney, who are they?”</p>

<p>“I have gone far an’ near, through north an’ through
south, up an’ down, by hill an’ hollow, till my toes were
corned an’ my heels in griskins, but could find no one able to
resolve that, or bring it clear out o’ the prophecy. They’re
to be sogers in black, an’ all their arms an’ ’coutrements is
to be the same colour; an’ farther than that is not known <em>as
yet</em>.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wondher <em>you</em> don’t know it, Barney, for there’s
little about prophecy that you haven’t at your finger ends.”</p>

<p>“Three birds is to meet (Barney proceeded in a kind of
recitative enthusiasm) upon the saes&mdash;two ravens an’ a dove&mdash;the
two ravens is to attack the dove until she’s at the point of
death; but before they take her life, an eagle comes and tears
the two ravens to pieces, an’ the dove recovers.</p>

<p>There’s to be two cries in the kingdom; one of them is
to rache from the Giants’ Causeway to the centre house of
the town of Sligo; the other is to rache from the Falls of
Beleek to the Mill of Louth, which is to be turned three times
with human blood; but this is not to happen until a man with
two thumbs an’ six fingers upon his right hand happens to
be the miller.”</p>

<p>“Who’s to give the sign of freedom to Ireland?”</p>

<p>“The little boy wid the red coat that’s born a dwarf, lives
a giant, and dies a dwarf again! He’s lightest of foot, but
leaves the heaviest foot-mark behind him. An’ it’s he that is
to give the sign of freedom to Ireland!”</p>

<p>“There’s a period to come when Antichrist is to be upon
the earth, attended by his two body servants Gog and Magog.
Who are they, Barney?”</p>

<p>“They are the sons of Hegog an’ Shegog, or in other
words, of Death an’ Damnation, and cousin-jarmins to the
Devil himself, which of coorse is the raison why he promotes
them.”</p>

<p>“Lord save us! But I hope that won’t he in our time,
Barney!”</p>

<p>“Antichrist is to come from the land of Crame o’ Tarthar
(Crim Tartary, according to Pastorini), which will account
for himself an’ his army breathin’ fire an’ brimstone out of
their mouths, according’ to the glorious Revelation of St John
the Divine, an’ the great prophecy of Pastorini, both of which
beautifully compromise upon the subject.</p>

<p>The prophet of the Black Stone is to come, who was born
never to prognosticate a lie. He is to be a mighty hunter,
an’ instead of riding to his fetlocks <em>in</em> blood, he is to ride <em>upon</em>
it, to the admiration of his times. It’s of him it is said ‘that
he is to be the only prophet that ever went on horseback!’</p>

<p>Then there’s Bardolphus, who, as there was a prophet wid
the red mouth, is called ‘the prophet wid the red nose.’ Ireland
was, it appears from ancient books, undher wather for
many hundred years before her discovery; but bein’ allowed
to become visible one day in every year, the enchantment was
broken by a sword that was thrown upon the earth, an’ from
that out she remained dry, an’ became inhabited. ‘Woe, woe,
woe,’ says Bardolphus, ‘the time is to come when we’ll have a
second deluge, an’ Ireland is to be undher wather once more.
A well is to open at Cork that will cover the whole island
from the Giants’ Causeway to Cape Clear. In them days St
Patrick will be despised, an’ will stand over the pleasant
houses wid his pasthoral crook in his hand, crying out <i lang="ga">Cead
mille failtha</i> in vain! Woe, woe, woe,’ says Bardolphus, ‘for
in them days there will be a great confusion of colours among
the people; there will be neither red noses nor pale cheeks, an’
the divine face of man, alas! will put forth blossoms no more.
The heart of the times will become changed; an’ when they
rise up in the morning, it will come to pass that there will be
no longer light heads or shaking hands among Irishmen!
Woe, woe, woe, men, women, and children will then die, an’ their
only complaint, like all those who perished in the flood of ould,
will be wather on the brain&mdash;wather on the brain! Woe, woe,
woe,’ says Bardolphus, ‘for the changes that is to come, an’
the misfortunes that’s to befall the many for the noddification
of the few! an’ yet such things must be, for I, in virtue of
the red spirit that dwells in me, must prophesy them. In
those times men will be shod in liquid fire an’ not be burned;
their breeches shall be made of fire, an’ will not burn them;
their bread shall be made of fire, an’ will not burn them;
their meat shall be made of fire, an’ will not burn them;
an’ why?&mdash;Oh, woe, woe, wather shall so prevail that the
coolness of their bodies will keep them safe; yea, they shall
even get fat, fair, an’ be full of health an’ strength, by
wearing garments wrought out of liquid fire, by eating
liquid fire, an’ all because they do not drink liquid fire&mdash;an’
this calamity shall come to pass,’ says Bardolphus, the prophet
of the red nose.</p>

<p>Two widows shall be grinding at the Mill of Louth (so
saith the prophecy); one shall be taken and the other left.”</p>

<p>Thus would Barney proceed, repeating such ludicrous and
heterogeneous mixtures of old traditionary prophecies and
spurious quotations from Scripture as were concocted for him
by those who took delight in amusing themselves and others
at the expense of his inordinate love for prophecy.</p>

<p>“But, Barney, touching the Mill o’ Louth, of the two
widows grindin’ there, whether will the one that is taken
or the one that is left be the best off?”</p>

<p>“The prophecy doesn’t say,” replied Barney, “an’ that’s
a matther that larned men are very much divided about.
My own opinion is, that the one that is taken will be the
best off; for St Bridget says ‘that betune wars an’ pestilences
an’ famine, the men are to be so scarce that several
of them are to be torn to pieces by the women in their
struggles to see who will get them for husbands.’<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> That
time they say is to come.”</p>

<p>“But, Barney, isn’t there many ould prophecies about
particular families in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“Ay, several: an’ I’ll tell you one of them, about a family
that’s not far from us this minute. You all know the hangin’
wall of the ould Church of Ballynasaggart, in Errigle Keeran
parish?”</p>

<p>“We do, to be sure; an’ we know the prophecy too.”</p>

<p>“Of coorse you do, bein’ in the neighbourhood. Well,
what is it in the mean time?”</p>

<p>“Why, that it’s never to fall till it comes down upon an’
takes the life of a M’Mahon.”</p>

<p>“Right enough; but do you know the raison of it?”</p>

<p>“We can’t say that, Barney; but, however, we’re at home
when you’re here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. St Keeran was, may be, next to St
Patrick himself, one of the greatest saints in Ireland, but any
rate we may put him next to St Columkill. Now, you see,
when he was building the church of Ballynasaggart, it came
to pass that there arose a great famine in the land, an’ the
saint found it hard to feed the workmen where there was no
vittles. What to do, he knew not, an’ by coorse he was at
a sad amplush, no doubt of it. At length says he, ‘Boys,
we’re all hard set at present, an’ widout food bedad we can’t
work; but if you observe my directions, we’ll contrive to have
a bit o’ mate in the mean time, an’, among ourselves, it was
seldom more wanted, for, to tell you the thruth, I never thought
my back an’ belly would become so well acquainted. For
the last three days they haven’t been asunder, an’ I find they
are perfectly willing to part as soon as possible, an’ would be
glad of any thing that ’ud put betune them.’</p>

<p>Now, the fact was, that, for drawin’ timber an’ stones, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
all the necessary matayrials for the church, they had but one
bullock, an’ him St Keeran resolved to kill in the evening, an’
to give them a fog meal of him. He accordingly slaughtered
him with his own hands, ‘but,’ said he to the workmen, ‘mind
what I say, boys: if any one of you breaks a single bone, even
the smallest, or injures the hide in the laste, you’ll destroy
all; an’ my sowl to glory but it’ll be worse for you besides.’</p>

<p>He then took all the flesh off the bones, but not till he had
boiled them, of coorse; afther which he sewed them up again
in the skin, an’ put them in the shed, wid a good wisp o’ straw
before them; an’ glory be to God, what do you think, but the
next mornin’ the bullock was alive, an’ in as good condition
as ever he was in during his life! Betther fed workmen you
couldn’t see, an’, bedad, the saint himself got so fat an’ rosy
that you’d scarcely know him to be the same man afther it.
Now, this went on for some time: whenever they wanted mate,
the bullock was killed, an’ the bones an’ skin kept safe as
before. At last it happened that a long-sided fellow among
them named M’Mahon, not satisfied wid his allowance of the
mate, took a fancy to have a lick at the marrow, an’ accordingly,
in spite of all the saint said, he broke one of the legs
an’ sucked the marrow out of it. But behold you!&mdash;the next
day when they went to yoke the bullock, they found that he was
useless, for the leg was broken an’ he couldn’t work. This,
to be sure, was a sad misfortune to them all, but it couldn’t
be helped, an’ they had to wait till betther times came; for the
truth is, that afther the marrow is broken, no power of man
could make the leg as it was before until the cure is brought about
by time. However, the saint was very much vexed, an’ good
right he had. ‘Now, M’Mahon,’ says he to the guilty man,
‘I ordher it, an’ prophesy that the church we’re building
will never fall till it falls upon the head of some one of your
name, if it was to stand a thousand years. Mark my words,
for they must come to pass.’</p>

<p>An’ sure enough you know as well as I do that it’s all
down long ago wid the exception of a piece of the wall, that’s
not standin’ but hangin’, widout any visible support in life, an’
only propped up by the prophecy. It can’t fall till a M’Mahon
comes undher it; but although there’s plenty of the name in
the neighbourhood, ten o’ the strongest horses in the kingdom
wouldn’t drag one of them widin half a mile of it. There,
now, is the prophecy that belongs to the hangin’ wall of
Ballynasaggart church.”</p>

<p>“But, Barney, didn’t you say something about the winged
woman that flewn to the wildherness?”</p>

<p>“I did; that’s a deep point, an’ it’s few that undherstands
it. The baste wid seven heads an’ ten horns is to come; an’
when he was to make his appearance, it was said to be time
for them that might be alive then to go to their padareens.”</p>

<p>“What does the seven heads and ten horns mane, Barney?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, as I am informed from good authority, the
baste has come, an’ it’s clear from the <em>ten</em> horns that he could
be no other than Harry the Eighth, who was married to <em>five</em>
wives, an’ by all accounts they strengthened an’ ornamented
him sore against his will. Now, set in case that each o’ them&mdash;five
times two is ten&mdash;hut! the thing’s as clear as crystal.
But I’ll prove it betther. You see the woman wid the two
wings is the church, an’ she flew into the wildherness at the
very time Harry the Eighth wid his ten horns on him was in
his greatest power.”</p>

<p>“Bedad that’s puttin’ the explanations to it in great style.”</p>

<p>“But the woman wid the wings is only to be in the wildherness
for a time, times, an’ half a time, that’s exactly three
hundred an’ fifty years, an’ afther that there’s to be no more
Prodestans.”</p>

<p>“Faith that’s great!”</p>

<p>“Sure Columkill prophesied that until H&nbsp;E&nbsp;M&nbsp;E&nbsp;I&nbsp;A&nbsp;M
should come, the church would be in no danger, but that afther
that she must be undher a cloud for a time, times, an’ half a
time, jist in the same way.”</p>

<p>“Well, but how do you explain that, Barney?”</p>

<p>“An’ St Bridget prophesied that when D&nbsp;O&nbsp;C is uppermost,
the church will be hard set in Ireland. But, indeed,
there’s no end to the prophecies that there is concerning Ireland
an’ the church. However, neighbours, do you know
that I feel the heat o’ the fire has made me rather drowsy,
an’ if you have no objection, I’ll take a bit of a nap. There’s
great things near us, any how. An’ talkin’ about DOC brings
to my mind another ould prophecy made up, they say, betune
Columkill and St Bridget; an’ it is this, that the triumph of
the counthry will never be at hand till the DOC flourishes in
Ireland.”</p>

<p>Such were the speculations upon which the harmless mind
of Barney M’Haighery ever dwelt. From house to house,
from parish to parish, and from province to province, did he
thus trudge, never in a hurry, but always steady and constant
in his motions. He might be not inaptly termed the Old
Mortality of traditionary prophecy, which he often chiselled
anew, added to, and improved, in a manner that generally gratified
himself and his bearers. He was a harmless kind man,
and never known to stand in need of either clothes or money.
He paid little attention to the silent business of ongoing life,
and was consequently very nearly an abstraction. He was
always on the alert, however, for the result of a battle; and
after having heard it, he would give no opinion whatsoever
until he had first silently compared it with his own private
theory in prophecy. If it agreed with this, he immediately
published it in connection with his established text; but if it
did not, he never opened his lips on the subject.</p>

<p>His class has nearly disappeared, and indeed it is so much
the better, for the minds of the people were thus filled with antiquated
nonsense that did them no good. Poor Barney, to
his great mortification, lived to see with his own eyes the
failure of his most favourite prophecies, but he was not to be
disheartened even by this; though some might fail, all could
not; and his stock was too varied and extensive not to furnish
him with a sufficient number of others over which to
cherish his imagination and expatiate during the remainder
of his inoffensive life.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ORIGIN AND MEANINGS OF IRISH FAMILY NAMES.</h2>

<p class="center">BY JOHN O’DONOVAN.</p>

<h3>Fifth Article.</h3>

<p>According to Mabillon, hereditary surnames were first established
in Italy in the tenth and eleventh centuries; but
Muratori shows that this statement cannot be correct, as in
the MSS. of the tenth century in the Ambrosian Library of
Milan, no trace can be found of surnames. In the ninth
and tenth centuries, to distinguish persons, their profession
or country is added to the Christian name, as Johannes
Scotus Erigena, Dungallus Scotus, Johannes Presbyter, Johannes
Clericus; the dignity is also sometimes added, as Comes
Marchio, without stating of what place. In the tenth century,
“A, the son of B, the son of C,” was another mode of designation.
It is said that the Venetians in the beginning of the
eleventh century adopted hereditary surnames, a custom
which they borrowed from the Greeks, with whom they carried
on a great trade. The Lombards adopted the same practice
after the fashion of the Venetians, and accordingly the
great family of Monticuli took that name from their castle in
Lombardy called Montecuculi, it being on the top of a hill.
The great house of Colonna took its name from the town and
castle of Columna about the year 1156; and about the same
time the noble family of Ursini derived its name from an ancestor
nicknamed Ursus, or Orso, on account of his ferocity.
Other noble families adopted names from the nickname given
to an ancestor, as the illustrious family of Malaspina (the bad
thorn) of Pavia, and the family of Malatesta (the bad head).
The family of Frangipani, so formidable to the Popes, took
that name in the twelfth century. The Rangones of Rome
took their name from an estate of theirs in Germany. The
Viscontes of Milan were so called from their title of Viscount,
which was borne by one of the family. These names appear
for the first time in the latter end of the twelfth century. I consider
it but proper to observe, that for this information on the
subject of Italian surnames we are indebted to the antiquary
whose name I have already mentioned, the accurate and laborious
Muratori.</p>

<p>To resume the history of surnames in Ireland. We have
seen in the last article that in the year 1682 the inferior
classes in Ireland, especially in Westmeath and the adjoining
counties, were very forward in accommodating themselves to
the English usages, particularly in their surnames, “which by
all manner of ways they strove to make English or English-like.”
This was more particularly the case after the defeat of
the Irish at the Boyne and Aughrim, when the Irish chieftains
were conquered, and the pride of the Irish people was
humbled. At this period, the Irish people, finding that their
ancient surnames sounded harshly in the ears of their conquerors
and new English masters, found it convenient to reduce
them as much as possible to the level of English pronunciation:
and they accordingly rejected in almost every instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
the O’ and Mac, and made various other changes in
their names, so as to give them an English appearance. Thus
a gentleman of the O’Neills in Tyrone changed his old name
of Felim O’Neill to Felix Neele, as we learn from an epigram
written in Latin on the subject by a witty scholar of the name
of Conway or Mac Conwy, whose Irish feeling had not been
blunted by the misfortunes of the times. The following translation
of this epigram is perhaps worth preserving:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All things has Felix changed, he has changed his name;</div>
<div class="verse">Yea, in himself he is no more the same.</div>
<div class="verse">Scorning to spend his days where he was reared,</div>
<div class="verse">To drag out life among the vulgar herd,</div>
<div class="verse">Or trudge his way through bogs in bracks and brogues,</div>
<div class="verse">He changed his creed and joined the Saxon rogues</div>
<div class="verse">By whom his sires were robbed; he laid aside</div>
<div class="verse">The arms they bore for centuries with pride,</div>
<div class="verse">The Ship, the Salmon, and the famed Red Hand,</div>
<div class="verse">And blushed when called O’Neill in his own land!</div>
<div class="verse">Poor, paltry skulker from thy noble race,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>Infelix Felix</em>, weep for thy disgrace!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Many others even of the most distinguished family names were
anglicised in a similar manner, as O’Conor to Conors and Coniers,
O’Brien to Brine, Mac Carthy to Carty, &amp;c. The respectability
of the O’s and Macs, however, was kept up on the
Continent by the warriors of the Irish Brigade, who preserved
every mark that would prove them to be of Irish origin; the Irish
having at this period become so illustrious for their military
skill, valour, and politeness, that they were sought after by all
the powers on the Continent of Europe. Thus we find O’Donnell
made Field Marshal, Chief General of Cavalry, Governor-General
of Transylvania, and Grand Croix of the Military
Order of St Theresa. The O’Flanigan of Tuaraah (John),
in the county of Fermanagh, became Colonel in the imperial
service; and his brother James O’Flanigan was Lieutenant-General
of Dillon’s regiment in France. O’Mahony became a
Count and Lieutenant-General of his Catholic Majesty’s forces,
and his Ambassador Plenipotentiary at the Court of Vienna;
Mac Gawley of the county of Cork became Colonel of a regiment
in Spain; O’Neny of Tyrone settled at Brussels,
and became Count of the Roman Empire, Councillor of
State to her Imperial Majesty, and Chief President of the
Privy Council at Brussels. A branch of the family of
O’Callaghan, who followed the fortunes of King James II,
became Baron O’Callaghan, and Grand Veneur (chasseur)
to his Serene Highness the Prince Margrave of Baden-Baden.
The head of the O’Mullallys, or O’Lallys of Tulach
na dala, two miles to the west of Tuam, in the county
of Galway, settled in France and became Count Lally-Tollendal
and a General in the French service. O’Conor Roe
became Governor of Civita Vecchia, a sea-port of great trust
in the Pope’s dominions, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The lustre derived from the renown of these warriors kept
up the respectability of the O’s and Macs on the Continent, and
induced many of the Irish at home to resume these prefixes,
especially the O’. Thus in our own time the name O’Conor
Don was assumed by Owen O’Conor, Esq. of Belanagare,
whose line was seven generations removed from the last ancestor
who had borne the name; and the name of the O’Grady
has also been assumed by Mr O’Grady of Kilballyowen, in
our own time, though none of his ancestors had borne it since
the removal of that family from Tomgraney, in the county of
Clare. Myles John O’Reilly, late of the Heath House, Queen’s
County, was at one time disposed to style himself the O’Reilly,
but I regret to say that his circumstances prevented him. Daniel
O’Connell, Esq. of Derrynane Abbey, prefixed the O’ after
it had been dropped for several generations; and I have heard
it constantly asserted that he has no <em>title</em> to the O’, because
his father, who did not know his pedigree, never prefixed it;
but such assertions have no weight with us, for we know that
O’Connell’s father never mentioned his own name in the original
Irish without prefixing O’, because it would be imperfect
without it. And whether O’Connell can trace his pedigree
with certainty up to Conall, chief of the tribe in the
tenth century, we know not, but we know that he ought to be
able to do so.</p>

<p>In like manner, Morgan William O’Donovan, of Mountpelier,
near Cork, has not only re-assumed the O’ which his ancestors
had rejected for eight generations, but also has styled
himself the O’Donovan, chief of his name, being the next of kin
to the last acknowledged head of that family, the late General
Richard O’Donovan of Bawnlahan, whose family became extinct
in the year 1829. His example has been followed by
Timothy O’Donovan, of O’Donovan’s Cove, head of a respectable
branch of the family. We like this Irish pride of ancestry,
and we hope that it will become general before many years
shall have passed.</p>

<p>There are other heads of families who retain their Irish
names with pride, as Sir Lucius O’Brien of Dromoland, in
Clare; Mac Dermot Roe of Alderford, in the county of Roscommon;
Mac Dermot of Coolavin, who is the lineal descendant
of the chief of Moylurg, and whose pedigree is as well
known as that of any royal family in Europe; O’Hara of Leyny,
in the county of Sligo; O’Dowda of Bunyconnellan, near Ballina,
in the county of Mayo; O’Loughlin of Burren, in the north
of the county of Clare; Mac Carthy of Carrignavar, near
Cork, who represents one of the noblest families in Ireland;
Mac Gillicuddy of the Reeks, in the county of Kerry, a collateral
branch of the same great family; O’Kelly of Ticooly,
in the county of Galway; O’Moore of Clough Castle, in the
King’s County; More O’Ferrall, M. P. O’Fflahertie, of Lemonfield,
in the same county; and John Augustus Mageoghegan
O’Neill, of Bunowen Castle, in the west of Connamara, in the
same county. We are not aware that any of the old families
of Leinster have preserved their ancient names unadulterated.
Of these, the Cavanaghs of Borris, in the county
of Carlow, are the most distinguished; and we indulge a hope
that the rising generation will soon resume the name of Mac
Murrogh Cavanagh, a name celebrated in Irish history for
great virtues as well as great vices.</p>

<p>Among the less distinguished families, however, the translation
and anglicising of names have gone on to so great a degree
as to leave no doubt that in the course of half a century
it will be difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish many families
of Irish name and origin from those of English name and
origin, unless, indeed, inquirers shall be enabled to do so by
the assistance of history and physiognomical characteristics.
The principal cause of the change of these names was the
difficulty which the magistrates and lawyers, who did not understand
the Irish language, found in pronouncing them, and
in consequence their constant habit of ridiculing them. This
made the Irish feel ashamed of all such names as were difficult
of pronunciation to English organs, and they were thus
led to change them by degrees, either by translating them
into what they conceived to be their meanings in English, by
assimilating them to local English surnames of respectable
families, or by paring them in such a manner as to make them
easy of pronunciation to English organs.</p>

<p>The families among the lower ranks who have translated,
anglicised, or totally changed their ancient surnames, are
very numerous, and are daily becoming more and more so.
Besides the cause already mentioned, we can assign two
reasons for this rage which prevails at present among the
lower classes for the continued adoption of English surnames.
First, the English language is becoming that universally spoken
among these classes, and there are many Irish surnames
which do not seem to sound very euphoniously in that modern
language; and, secondly, the names translated or totally
changed are, with very few exceptions, of no celebrity in Irish
history; and when they do not sound well in English, the bearers
naturally wish to get rid of them, in order that they should not
be considered of Atticotic or plebeian Irish origin. As this
change is going on rapidly in every part of Ireland, I shall
here, for the information, if not for the amusement, of the
reader, give some account of the Milesian or Scotic names
that have thus become metamorphosed.</p>

<p>And first, of names which have been translated correctly
or incorrectly. In the county of Sligo the ancient name of
O’Mulclohy has been metamorphosed into Stone, from an
idea that <i lang="ga">clohy</i>, the latter part of it, signifies a <em>stone</em>, but it
is a mere guess translation; so that in this instance this
people may be said to have taken a new name. In the county
of Leitrim, the ancient and by no means obscure name of
Mac Connava has been rendered Forde, from an erroneous
notion that <i lang="ga">ava</i>, the last part of it, is a corruption of <i lang="ga">atha</i>, <em>of
a ford</em>. This is also an instance of false translation, for we
know that Mac Connava, chief of Munter Kenny, in the
county of Leitrim, took his name from his ancestor Cusnava,
who flourished in the tenth century. In Thomond the
ancient name of O’Knavin is now often anglicised Bowen,
because Knavin signifies a <em>small bone</em>. This change was first
made by a butcher in Dublin, who should perhaps be excused,
as he conformed so well to the act of 5 Edward IV. In
Tirconnell the ancient name of O’Mulmoghery is now always
rendered Early, because <i lang="ga">moch-eirghe</i> signifies <em>early rising</em>.
This version, however, is excusable, though not altogether
correct. In Thomond, O’Marcachain is translated Ryder by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
some, but anglicised Markham by others; and in the same
territory O’Lahiff is made Guthrie, which is altogether incorrect.
In Tyrone the ancient name of Mac Rory is now
invariably made Rogers, because Roger is assumed to be the
English Christian name corresponding to the Irish Ruaidhri or
Rory. In Connamara, in the west of the county of Galway, the
ancient name of Mac Conry is now always made King, because
it is assumed that <em>ry</em>, the last syllable of it, is from <i lang="ga">righ</i>,
a king; but this is a gross error, for this family, who are of
Dalcassian origin, took their surname from their ancestor
Curoi, a name which forms Conroi in the genitive case, and has
nothing to do with <i lang="ga">righ</i>, a king; and the Kings of Connamara
would therefore do well to drop their false name, a name to
which they have no right, and re-assume their proper ancient
and excellent name of Mac Conry, through which alone their
pedigree and their history can be traced.</p>

<p>These examples, selected out of a long list of Irish surnames,
erroneously translated, are sufficient to show the false
process by which the Irish are getting rid of their ancient
surnames. I shall next exhibit a few specimens of Irish surnames
which have been assimilated to English or Scotch ones,
from a fancied resemblance in the sounds of both.</p>

<p>In Ulster, Mac Mahon, the name of the celebrated chiefs
of Oriel, a name which, as we have already seen, the poet
Spenser attempted to prove to be an Irish form of Fitzursula,
is now very frequently anglicised Matthews; and Mac Cawell,
the name of the ancient chiefs of Kinel Ferady, is anglicised
Camphill, Campbell, Howell, and even Cauldfield. In Thomond,
the name O’Hiomhair is anglicised Howard among the
peasantry, and Ivers among the gentry, which looks strange
indeed! And in the same county, the ancient Irish name of
O’Beirne is metamorphosed to Byron; while in the original
locality of the name, in Tir-Briuin na Sinna, in the east of
the county of Roscommon, it is anglicised Bruin among the
peasantry; but among the gentry, who know the historical
respectability of the name, the original form O’Beirne is retained.
In the province of Connaught we have met a family
of the name of O’Heraghty, who anglicised their old Scotic
name to Harrington, an innovation which we consider almost
unpardonable. In the city of Limerick, the illustrious name of
O’Shaughnessy is metamorphosed to Sandys, by a family who
know their pedigree well; for no other reason, perhaps, than
to disguise the Irish origin of the family; but we are glad to
find it retained by the Roman Catholic Dean of Ennis, and
also by Mr O’Shaughnessy of Galway, who, though now reduced
to the capacity of a barber in the town of Galway, is
the chief of his name, and now the senior representative of
Guaire Aidhne, king of Connaught, who is celebrated in Irish
history as the personification of hospitality. Strange turn
of affairs! In the county of Londonderry, the celebrated old
name O’Brollaghan is made to look English by being transmuted
to Bradley, an English name of no lustre, at least in
Ireland. In the county of Fermanagh, the O’Creighans have
changed their name to Creighton, for no other reason than
because a Colonel Creighton lives in their vicinity; and in
the county of Leitrim, O’Fergus, the descendant of the ancient
Erenachs of Rossinver, has, we are sorry to say, lately
changed his name to Ferguson. Throughout the province of
Ulster generally, very extraordinary changes have been made
in the names of the aborigines; as, Mac Teige, to Montague;
O’Mulligan, to Molyneaux; Mac-Gillycuskly, to Cosgrove;
Mac Gillyglass, to Greene; O’Tuathalain, to Toland and
Thulis; O’Hay, to Hughes; O’Carellan, to Carleton, as, for instance,
our own William Carleton, the depicter of the manners,
customs, and superstitions of the Irish, who is of the old Milesian
race of the O’Cairellans, the ancient chiefs of Clandermot,
in the present county of Londonderry; O’Howen, to
Owens; Mac Gillyfinen, to Leonard; Mac Shane, to Johnson,
and even Johnston; O’Gneeve, to Agnew; O’Clery, to Clarke;
Mac Lave, to Hande; Mac Guiggin, to Goodwin; O’Hir,
to Hare; O’Luane, to Lamb; Mac Conin, to Canning;
O’Haughey, to Howe; O’Conwy, to Conway; O’Loingsy, to
Lynch; Mac Namee, to Meath, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>In Connaught, O’Greighan is changed to Graham; O’Cluman,
to Coalman; O’Naghton, to Norton; Mac Rannal, to
Reynolds; O’Heosa, to Hussey; Mac Firbis, to Forbes;
O’Hargadon, to Hardiman (the learned author of the History
of Galway, and compiler of the Irish Minstrelsy, is of this
name, and not of English origin, as the present form of his
name would seem to indicate); O’Mulfover, to Milford;
O’Tiompain, to Tenpenny; O’Conagan, to Conyngham;
O’Heyne, to Hindes and Hynes; O’Mulvihil, to Melville;
O’Rourke, to Rooke; Mac Gillakilly, to Cox and Woods. In
Munster, O’Sesnan is changed to Sexton; O’Shanahan, to
Fox; O’Turran, to Troy; O’Mulligan, to Baldwin; O’Hiskeen,
to Hastings; O’Nia, to Neville (in every instance!);
O’Corey, to Curry; O’Sheedy, to Silke; O’Mulfaver, to
Palmer; O’Trehy, to Foote; O’Honeen, to Greene; O’Connaing,
to Gunning; O’Murgaly, to Morley; O’Kinsellagh, to
Kingsley and Tinsly; Mac Gillymire, to Merryman; O’Hehir,
to Hare; O’Faelchon, to Wolfe; O’Barran, to Barrington;
O’Keatey, to Keating; O’Connowe, to Conway; O’Credan,
to Creed; O’Feehily, to Pickley; O’Ahern, to Heron, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Scores of similar instances might be given, but the number
exhibited is sufficient to show the manner in which the Irish
are assimilating their names with those of their conquerors.</p>

<h3>NO. II.&mdash;AN IRISH HERDSMAN’S DOG.</h3>

<p>After King Olave had married his Irish spouse Gyda, he
dwelt partly in England, partly in Ireland. While King
Olave was in Ireland, it so happened that he was engaged in
a certain expedition attended by a great naval force. When
they were short of plunder, they went ashore, and drove off a
great multitude of cattle. Then a certain peasant followed
them, begging that they would return him the cows which belonged
to him in the herd they were driving away. King
Olave answered, “Drive off your cows, if you know them,
and can separate them from the herd of oxen, so as not to
delay our journey; but I believe that neither you nor any
one else can do this, from among so many hundreds of oxen
as we are driving.” The peasant had a large herdsman’s
dog, which he ordered to sort the herds of oxen that were
collected. The dog ran about through all the herds of oxen,
and drove off as many oxen as the peasant had said he
wanted; all these oxen were marked in the same manner, from
which they inferred that the dog had rightly distinguished
them. Then the king says, “Your dog is very sagacious,
peasant! will you give me the dog?” He answered, “I will,
with pleasure.” The king immediately gave him a large gold
ring, and promised him his friendship. This dog was named
Vigins, and he was of all dogs the most sagacious and the
best; that dog was long in King Olave’s possession.</p>

<h3>First Article.</h3>

<p>A few years ago a conjuror made his appearance in London,
whose performances were so wonderful that his audience, instead
of being confined to the foolish and thoughtless people
who usually encourage such exhibitions, included many of the
most eminent philosophers and scientific men of the day. It
may naturally be supposed that his feats must have been more
than usually ingenious, to attract persons of such consequence;
and indeed many of them were so wonderful, that, had he ventured
to exhibit them a century or two ago, they would inevitably
have led him to the stake or the scaffold, for having too
intimate an acquaintance with a certain disreputable personage
whom it is not necessary to particularize by name. This
great conjuror defied all the ordinary laws of nature. He
would not condescend to exhibit such vulgar mountebank
tricks as crunching red-hot coals in his mouth, and dining on
tenpenny nails; but he struck the faculty with the greatest
horror, by making poison of all kinds his common food;
breakfasting on a strong solution of arsenic, and taking a
short drachm of prussic acid before dinner, as a whet for his
appetite. More wonderful still was his manner of preparing
this dinner: he used to have an oven heated intensely, every
day, into which he walked, or crawled, with the greatest composure,
taking with him a raw beef-steak, which in the course
of seven or eight minutes was well cooked by the intense heat of
the place, whilst the only effect of its high temperature on him
was to quicken his pulse a little, and produce a gentle perspiration.
Fire, indeed, appeared his element, and so perfectly
could he control and master it, that he received almost by
acclamation the title of “the Fire King.”</p>

<p>Human greatness, however is but transitory, and even the
laurels of the Fire King were wrested from him by the envious
doctors of the metropolis, who wished him to drink prussic
acid of <em>their own manufacture</em>, an invitation which he very politely
and prudently declined. But though on this account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
suspicion was cast on his pretensions as a poison-drinker, yet
his reputation as a “Fire King” remained untarnished. He
could continue in an oven heated above the temperature at
which water boils, and he did so daily. There was no trick
in this performance, for he used to take raw eggs into the
oven with him, and send them out to the company, well done
by the heat of the place alone. It was thought no man could
imitate his example. But however wonderful the feats of this
conjuror may appear to persons unacquainted with science,
and while it must be confessed they were performed with an
appearance of daring and temerity which certainly entitled
the exhibitor to some degree of praise, yet his performances
were merely a striking illustration of the power which every
individual possesses of regulating the temperature of his own
body; and there was scarcely one person of his audience but
might himself have been the exhibitor, with very little training
and with very little courage.</p>

<p>Of all the functions of the human body one of the most
wonderful is that by which it maintains in every climate, and
in every variety of season, an almost equal temperature. It
would appear to be necessary for the due performance of the
vital functions that this temperature should never suffer any
great degree of variation, and nature has accordingly provided
the means by which, when exposed to cold, the body can
generate heat; and when exposed to heat, so reduce its temperature
that no inconvenience shall result. Before considering
the manner in which these very different though equally
necessary results are produced, it will not be uninteresting to
notice a few examples of the power of endurance shown by
human beings and the lower animals in regard to extremes
of temperature. In another paper we will endeavour to explain
the cause.</p>

<p>One of the most striking and familiar of the laws of heat is
what is termed by philosophers “its tendency to an equilibrium.”
For instance, if a heated iron ball is suspended
nearly in contact with one quite cold, the former in a short
time will have imparted so much of its heat to the latter that
they will soon become almost of equal temperature. If a
penny piece is thrown into a kettle of boiling water it will
soon become as hot as the boiling water itself. If a cup of
water is exposed to a temperature below 32 degrees, it parts
with so much of its natural heat, to come into a state of equilibrium
with the medium in which it is placed, that it is converted
into ice. These and many more familiar instances
might be mentioned as illustrating the law of heat above
alluded to. In short, it may be received as one of the best established
facts in philosophy, that any substance, no matter
what may be its texture or natural qualities, provided it does
not possess life, will soon acquire and maintain the same temperature
as that of the medium in which it is placed, so long
as it continues in that medium. A piece of the metal platinum
in the furnace of a glass-house may be kept at a white heat
for years; a similar piece of metal, in an ice-house, will remain
below 32 degrees so long as it is kept there.</p>

<p>It would be unnecessary to notice so particularly these
well-known facts, but that they will tend to render more striking
the power which living bodies possess of resisting the law
to which all unorganized bodies are subject. Any thing possessing
life <em>can maintain a different temperature to the medium
in which it lives</em>. The natural heat of fishes is two or three
degrees above that of the water in which they live; the natural
heat of creatures which live within the bowels of the earth,
like the earth-worm for example, is as much above the usual
temperature of the earth; while man himself maintains the
heat of his body, as shown by the thermometer placed under
the tongue or armpits, at about 98 degrees, under every
variety of season, and in every climate under the sun. Were
a human being to be kept imprisoned in an ice-house, the heat
of his body could never sink to 32 degrees (the freezing point)
while life remained. In these mighty reservoirs of ice and
cold, the arctic regions, the blood of the rude creatures who
exist there is as warm as that of ourselves; and at the torrid
zone, where the heat of the sun is almost insupportable, the
animal heat of the human frame is only one or two degrees
higher than it is at the frozen poles.</p>

<p>The power of the superior animals, and especially of man,
to resist high degrees of temperature, is very extraordinary.
The account of the performances of the “Fire King” already
noticed, is a sufficient proof of this. Dr Southwood Smith,
in his excellent treatise on “Animal Physiology,” gives a far
more interesting description, however, of the accidental discovery
of this property of life, from which we quote the following
particulars:&mdash;“In the year 1760, at Rochefoucault,
Messrs Du Hamel and Tillet, having occasion to use a large
public oven on the same day in which bread had been baked
in it, wished to ascertain with precision its degree of temperature.
This they endeavoured to accomplish by introducing
a thermometer into the oven at the end of a shovel. On
being withdrawn, the thermometer indicated a degree of heat
considerably above that of boiling water; but M. Tillet, convinced
that the thermometer had fallen several degrees on
approaching the mouth of the oven, and appearing to be at a
loss how to rectify this error, a girl, one of the attendants on
the oven, offered to enter and mark with a pencil the height
at which the thermometer stood within the oven. The girl
smiled at M. Tillet’s appearing to hesitate at this strange
proposition, and entering the oven, marked with a pencil the
thermometer as standing at 260 degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale.
M. Tillet began to express his anxiety for the welfare of his
female assistant, and to press her return. This female salamander,
however, assuring him that she felt no inconvenience
from her situation, remained there ten minutes longer, when
at length, the thermometer standing at that time at 288 degrees,
or 76 degrees above that of boiling water, she came out
of the oven, her complexion indeed considerably heightened,
but her respiration by no means quick or laborious. The publication
of this transaction exciting a great degree of attention,
several philosophers repeated similar experiments,
amongst which the most accurate and decisive were those performed
by Doctors Fordyce and Blagden. The rooms in
which these celebrated experimenters conducted their researches
were heated by flues in the floor. There was neither
any chimney in them, nor any vent for the air, excepting
through the crevice at the door. Having taken off his coat,
waistcoat, and shirt, and being furnished with wooden shoes
tied on with lint, Dr Blagden went into one of the rooms as
soon as the thermometer indicated a degree of heat above
that of boiling water. The first impression of this heated air
upon his body was exceedingly disagreeable, but in a few
minutes his uneasiness was removed by a profuse perspiration.
At the end of twelve minutes he left the room, very much
fatigued, but no otherwise disordered. The thermometer
had risen to 220 degrees; the boiling point is 212 degrees.
In other experiments it was found that a heat even of 260
degrees could be borne with tolerable ease. At these high
temperatures every piece of metal about the body of the experimenters
became intolerably hot; small quantities of water
placed in metallic vessels quickly boiled. Though the air of
this room, which at one period indicated a heat of 264 degrees,
could be breathed with impunity, yet of course the finger
could not be put into the boiling water, which indicated only
a heat of 212 degrees; nor could it bear the touch of quicksilver
heated only to 120 degrees, nor scarcely that of spirits
of wine at 110 degrees. But in a physiological view, the most
curious and important point to be noticed is, that while the
body was thus exposed to a temperature of 264 degrees, the
heat of the body itself never rose above 101 degrees, or at
most 102 degrees. In one experiment, while the heat of the
room was 202 degrees, the heat of the body was only 99½
degrees; its natural temperature in a state of health being
98 degrees.”</p>

<p>A similar power of withstanding extreme degrees of temperature
is one of the peculiar properties of every thing possessing
life. It is well known that an egg containing the living
principle possesses the power of self-preservation for several
weeks, although exposed to a degree of heat which would
occasion the putrifaction of dead animal matter. During the
period of incubation (hatching) the egg is kept at a heat of
103 degrees, the hen’s egg for three, that of the duck for
four weeks; yet when the chick is hatched, the entire yolk is
found perfectly sweet, and that part of the white which has
not been expended in the nourishment of the young bird is
also quite fresh. It is found that if the living principle be
destroyed, as it may be instantaneously, by passing the electric
fluid through the egg, it becomes putrid in the same time
as other dead animal matter. The power of the egg in resisting
cold is proved to be equally great by several curious
experiments of Hunter, the celebrated physiologist, which
were so managed as to show at the same time both the power
of the vital principle in resisting the physical agent, and
the influence of the physical agent in diminishing the energy
of the vital principle. Thus he exposed an egg to the temperature
of 17 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, he found
that it took about half an hour to freeze it. When thawed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
and again exposed to a cold atmosphere, it was frozen in one
half the time, and when only at the temperature of 25 degrees.
He then put a fresh egg, and one that had previously
been frozen and again thawed, into a cold mixture at 15 degrees:
the dead egg was frozen twenty-five minutes sooner
than the fresh one. It is obvious that in the one case the undiminished
vitality of the fresh egg enabled it to resist the low
temperature for so long a period; in the other case the diminished
or destroyed vitality of the frozen egg occasioned
it speedily to yield to the influence of the physical agent.</p>

<p>Animals can withstand the effects of heat far better than
the severity of cold. The human frame suffers comparatively
little even in the burning deserts of Arabia, compared with
what it endures in those wastes of ice and snow which form
the polar regions. Here the body is stunted in its growth;
there is no energy of mind or character; and life itself is only
preserved by extraordinary care and attention. When a
person is exposed to intense cold, it produces partial imbecility;
he neglects even those precautions which may enable
him to withstand its severity. He refuses to exercise his
limbs, without which they become torpid; and, unable to resist
the drowsiness that seizes on his frame, he resigns himself to
its influence, becomes insensible, and dies. Even in our own
climate this is not an unfrequent occurrence; and we cannot
conclude this paper better than by quoting the expressive
lines of Thomson, describing the death of an unhappy peasant
from the severity of a winter storm:&mdash;</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Gravity.</span>&mdash;Gravity is an arrant scoundrel, and one of the
most dangerous kind too, because a sly one; and we verily believe
that more honest, well-meaning people are bubbled out
of their goods and money by it in one twelvemonth, than by
pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. The very essence
of gravity is design, and consequently deceit; it is in fact a
taught trick to gain credit with the world for more sense and
knowledge than a man is really worth.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">WAR.</h2>

<p>War, it is said, kindles patriotism; by fighting for our country
we learn to love it. But the patriotism which is cherished by
war, is ordinarily false and spurious, a vice and not a virtue, a
scourge to the world, a narrow unjust passion, which aims to
exalt a particular state on the humiliation and destruction of
other nations. A genuine enlightened patriot discerns that
the welfare of his own country is involved in the general progress
of society; and in the character of a patriot, as well
as of a Christian, he rejoices in the liberty and prosperity of
other communities, and is anxious to maintain with them the
relations of peace and amity.</p>

<p>It is said that a military spirit is the defence of a country.
But it more frequently endangers the vital interests of a nation,
by embroiling it with other states. This spirit, like every
other passion, is impatient for gratification, and often precipitates
a country into unnecessary war. A people have no
need of a military spirit. Let them be attached to their government
and institutions by habit, by early associations, and
especially by experimental conviction of their excellence, and
they will never want means or spirit to defend them.</p>

<p>War is recommended as a method of redressing national
grievances. But unhappily the weapons of war, from their
very nature, are often wielded most successfully by the unprincipled.
Justice and force have little congeniality. Should
not Christians everywhere strive to promote the reference of
national as well as of individual disputes to an impartial umpire?
Is a project of this nature more extravagant than the
idea of reducing savage hordes to a state of regular society?
The last has been accomplished. Is the first to be abandoned
in despair?</p>

<p>It is said that war sweeps off the idle, dissolute, and vicious
members of the community. Monstrous argument! If a
government may for this end plunge a nation into war, it may
with equal justice consign to the executioner any number of
its subjects whom it may deem a burden on the state. The
fact is, that war commonly generates as many profligates as
it destroys. A disbanded army fills the community with at
least as many abandoned members as at first it absorbed.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that a military spirit favours liberty.
But how is it, that nations, after fighting for ages, are so generally
enslaved? The truth is, that liberty has no foundation
but in private and public virtue; and virtue, as we have
seen, is not the common growth of war.</p>

<p>But the great argument remains to be discussed. It is said
that without war to excite and invigorate the human mind,
some of its noblest energies will slumber, and its highest qualities,
courage, magnanimity, fortitude, will perish. To this
I answer, that if war is to be encouraged among nations
because it nourishes energy and heroism, on the same principle
war in our families, and war between neighbourhoods,
villages, and cities, ought to be encouraged; for such contests
would equally tend to promote heroic daring and contempt of
death. Why shall not different provinces of the same empire
annually meet with the weapons of death, to keep alive their
courage? We shrink at this suggestion with horror; but
why shall contests of nations, rather than of provinces or
families, find shelter under this barbarous argument?</p>

<p>I observe again: if war be a blessing, because it awakens energy
and courage, then the savage state is peculiarly privileged;
for every savage is a soldier, and his whole modes of life tend
to form him to invincible resolution. On the same principle,
those early periods of society were happy, when men were
called to contend, not only with one another, but with beasts
of prey; for to these excitements we owe the heroism of Hercules
and Theseus. On the same principle, the feudal ages
were more favoured than the present; for then every baron
was a military chief, every castle frowned defiance, and every
vassal was trained to arms. And do we really wish that the
earth should again be overrun with monsters, or abandoned
to savage or feudal violence, in order that heroes may be multiplied?
If not, let us cease to vindicate war as affording
excitement to energy and courage.&mdash;<cite>Channing.</cite></p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
